# 600 French Novels in Derived Text Format

This is a balanced collection of 600 contemporary French novels from three decades (1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), organized into four subgenres (romance novel, crime fiction, science fiction, and high prestige novel), with 50 novels from each subgenre and decade. All the texts were converted into a derived format. More precisely, each text was first split into 1,000-word segments, and then the sequence of the 1,000 words in each segment was randomized. 

The principles, parameters, applications and limitations of the "Derived Text Formats", inspired by initiatives such as the Google Ngram Corpus and the Hathi Trust's Extracted Features Dataset, are described in more detail in the following paper:
